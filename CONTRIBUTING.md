# Contributing to openGym

Thanks for taking a look! openGym is intentionally small and dependency-light, and the goal is
to keep it that way — easy to read, easy to self-host.

## Project layout

```
frontend/       React + Vite app (src/views, src/components, src/store, src/lib). Builds to static files.
                android/ + ios/ are the Capacitor shells for the standalone mobile app (docs/MOBILE.md).
firestore.rules access control for the Firestore database — the only backend piece left.
docs/           Firebase setup guide.
```

There's no backend of openGym's own anymore — the app talks straight to a Firebase project
(Auth + Firestore) you configure. Exercise images/GIFs are pulled from a CDN mirror of the
source dataset (`frontend/src/lib/exercises.js`), not bundled or self-hosted.

## Running for development

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # paste your own Firebase project's config in — see docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
# training logic (progression rules, 1RM, how a session is read back):
npm test
```

## Guidelines

- **Keep it dependency-light.** The frontend uses React + Router + Zustand + the Firebase client
  SDK and nothing else — new deps are a hard sell.
- **Match the style.** Small components, clear names, comments only where the "why" isn't obvious.
  State lives in the Zustand store (`src/store`); pure helpers in `src/lib`.
- **Don't commit** your own `.env` — it's gitignored; `.env.example` is the template.
- **Test the flow** you touched — click through the affected screens (and the workout flow) in a
  browser before opening a PR.
- **Training logic gets a unit test.** Anything deciding what you lift next, or reading a logged
  session back, belongs in a pure helper in `src/lib` with tests beside it (`npm test`). These
  rules are easy to get subtly wrong and nearly impossible to verify by clicking — the
  progression engine grew two real bugs that only a test pinned down.

## Good first issues

- Additional starter plans (upper/lower, full-body, 5×5…)
- More languages for the exercise instructions (the dataset ships several)
- Percentage / training-max programming (5/3/1-style) on top of the progression engine in
  `src/lib/progression.js` — the policy interface is already there
- Accessibility passes on the workout and chart screens

## Where to ask what

| You have | Goes to |
| --- | --- |
| A question, or self-hosting that won't behave | [Discussions → Q&A](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/discussions/categories/q-a) |
| An idea you're not sure about yet | [Discussions → Ideas](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/discussions/categories/ideas) |
| A reproducible bug | [Issues](https://github.com/DuarteSantos8/openGym/issues) |
| A change you've already built | A pull request |

An answered question in Q&A is worth more than the same answer buried in a closed issue — the
next person searching "passkey login fails behind my reverse proxy" actually finds it.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with: what you did, what you expected, what happened, and your browser/OS. If it's
about login/passkeys, include your `RP_ID`/`ORIGIN` (not the `data/` contents) — most login
issues are an origin mismatch.
